          Smartphones messing up our attension span is already old news. But we
          rarely do something about it. Few months ago though, I've finally
          decided to do something about it. Between endless scrolling,
          algorithm-curated dopamine hits, and the constant ping of
          notifications, our ability to sustain deep focus has taken a massive
          hit. This isn’t just a productivity issue but a survival issue. It's
          about time we rewire our brains to funtion.. well, to funtion
          normally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every big tech spends billions to buy your attension. No wonder you're
          always distracted. Your attention span gets “trained” to expect
          novelty every few seconds, and when you sit down to do something
          sustained like reading an article or code, your mind rebels and starts
          wandering. It’s not that you’re broken, it’s just that your focus
          muscle is out of shape.
        </p>

        <!-- <aside class="pullquote">
          “Make progress obvious. If you can point to it at 5pm, you’ll ship
          again tomorrow.”
        </aside> -->

        <p>
          I asked chatGPT the 3 things I can do to fix this. The answers
          un-surprisingly made sense. Here are three things I picked up and
          applied to my own life.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Boredome rules</h2>
        <p>
          Your brain needs to learn how to sit still again. Choose everyday
          tasks that don’t flood you with stimulation. This helps rebuild
          patience and comfort with slow focus. So go ahead and start with
          delibrately boring, offline activities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wash dishes, fold laundry, or sweep the floor quietly. No music, no
            podcast and just give your comfort show a break.
          </li>
          <li>Sit on a chair or couch for 5 minutes without your phone</li>
          <li>Go for a short walk outside with no music or podcasts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have the time, go watch (<a
            href="https://youtu.be/_GQUP4ABIGU?si=wKQRFEmOpfsVSnGn"
            >this</a
          >) youtube video by Michelle Gia, where she speaks how making yourself
          bored actually helps with understimulating your nervous system. 10/10,
          worth a watch.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Quit multitasking</h2>

        <p>
          Splitting your focus weakens your ability to go deep on one thing.
          Give yourself permission to do just one activity at a time.
          Multitasking was never real. It really is just rapid task-switching
          that leaves the brain more drained than if we had focused on one
          thing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are reading, only read. Hide your phone away. Mama was always
            right, it's the damn phones.
          </li>
          <li>When you eat, focus on the food instead of scrolling</li>
          <li>
            If you are coding, when you're really in the zone, keep all other
            tabs closed unless they are for that task
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm not gonna lie, all these really worked well for me. But let me
          tell you something. quitting social media and deleting YouTube from my
          phone made the biggest difference. It felt uncomfortable at first,
          like I was missing out or cutting off my main source of entertainment.
          But within a few days, I started noticing a shift. My mind felt less
          noisy, I stopped reaching for my phone every five minutes, and I
          actually had space to focus on one thing at a time. For the first time
          in months, I felt calm, in control, and fully present in whatever I
          was doing. Honestly, nothing has boosted my focus and clarity more
          than this single change.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Work in chunks</h2>

        <!-- Inline image

        </figure> -->

        <p>
          Chunking isn’t new. At its core, it’s about breaking tasks into
          smaller, time-bound sprints of focus. But in 2025, chunking isn’t just
          about efficiency. It's about tricking our dopamine-hijacked brains
          into doing meaningful work.
        </p>
        <p>How to Do It</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Pick Chunk Size: Start at 25 minutes, extend to 45.</li>
          <li>One Task, One Chunk: Single outcome, no parallel threads.</li>
          <li>Timer + Ritual: Timer on, focus. Timer off, walk away.</li>
          <li>Stack Chunks: 3–4 in a row = hours of true productivity.</li>
          <li>Design for Depth: Remove interruptions before you begin.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No background noise, no scattered to-dos, no quick phone checks. Just
          one task, one chunk, 100%. It feels uncomfortable at first because it
          strips away the illusion of multitasking. But the payoff is clarity.
          You actually finish what you set out to do. You relearn what it feels
          like to be absorbed in a task. And each completed chunk becomes its
          own reward, teaching your brain that focus can be just as satisfying
          as a scroll.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a hack. It’s a survival strategy for 2025. In a world
          engineered to scatter your attention, the ability to work in chunks
          and to give your full mind to one thing at a time is not optional.
          It’s the only way forward.
        </p>
